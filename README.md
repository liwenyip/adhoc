# Remote Ad Hoc Sensor Networks
by Li-Wen Yip, 2005

This is my undergraduate honours thesis, completed in 2005 as part of my BE(Computer Systems).

**tl;dr**: It involved building some circuit boards with antennae, and writing a lot of code to make the circuit boards talk to each other wirelessly.

- **[Website](https://liwenyip.github.io/adhoc)**: Provides a good overview of the project, and if nothing else is a great example of cutting edge web design in 2006.
- **[Presentations](Presentations)**: Also provides a good overview of the project. The first one has speaker notes in the `ppt` file; the other two don't have any speaker notes for some reason so they may make limited sense.
- **[Final report](YipThesis2005.pdf)** (PDF, 188 pages): Contains all of the juicy technical details.
- **[PCB designs](Appendix%20X%20-%20%20PCB%20Designs), [Microcontroller code](Appendix%20E%20-%20Microcontroller%20Code), [ns-2 simulator code](Appendix%20D%20-%20ns-2%20Simulation)**: Just in case you want to replicate my work.

## Licence

All of my work is published under the [MIT Licence](LICENCE.md).

## Previous and subsequent work

My thesis was a continuation of previous work by [Nigel Sim](https://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/contact/past-members/nigel-sim) (2003) and [Steven Sloots](https://au.linkedin.com/in/steven-sloots-38b22927) (2004). If you want to know more about their work, I can put you in touch with them. (I do have copies of their thesis reports, but they aren't mine to publish.)

The project was continued in 2006 by [William Harrington](http://www.harringtonsystems.com.au).
